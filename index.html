  <h2 id="Intro">Introduction</h2>
  <img src="recources/IMG_1647.jpg" width="386" height="514">
  <p>&emsp;Hello! My name is Caden Tedeschi. I am attending Northern Arizona University as an undergraduate student
    pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I am expecting to graduate Fall 2024 and my current GPA is 3.14.
    I'm originally from Phoenix, Arizona, and plan on moving back into that area once I graduate. I have been
    learning and practicing programming since I was a Freshman in highschool and I have loved it ever since. My
    aspirations in this field is to go into game development or software development.
    Thank you for taking the time to read and look at this page! :)</p>

  <h2 id="Projects">Projects</h2>
  <p>&emsp;Throughout my college experience I have done many projects that were needed for my classes but here are a few
    that I believe are the most important to list.
    This list will be updated as time goes on.</p>

  <ul class="projectList">
    <li><a href="https://github.com/cs386-03/SideQuests">SideQuests</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/CadenTed/CatnipCatcher">Catnip Catcher</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/CS413-CarGame/CarGame">CarGame</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h4>SideQuests</h4>
  <p>&emsp;SideQuests was a semester long group project. This was a project that was during our Software Engineering
    class that taught skills of teamwork and development methods as well as the whole process of wokring on a project in
    a professional setting.
    SideQuests is a MVP website that would allow for task tracking with a reward system to "Gameify" compeleting tasks
    off of a to-do list. I personally worked on the profile/rewards page of the website.
    These pages were to keep track of user profile data and the points that a user would get while completing tasks and
    display the trohpies earned accordingly.</p>

  <h4>Catnip Catcher</h4>
  <p>&emsp;Catnip Catcher is a work in progress game that I have been working on solo for the past few months. It is
    being made in Unity so I am learning C# and the unity editor envrionment as well. Catnip catcher is a 2D overhead
    perspective game
    where the player can become one of two different cats. The objective of the game is to grab 15 bags of catnip as
    one of these cats without losing your 9 lives.</p>

  <h4>CarGame</h4>
  <p>&emsp;CarGame is a work in progress semester long group project. This is a project for my Virtual Worlds class.
    This class goes over Unity, C#, and Unity's ECS and DOTS system.
    CarGame is a wave survival zombie driving game. The player takes control of the main truck character and the goal
    is to survive as long as possible. The zombies progressively do more damage and get faster and do more damage
    as time goes on.</p>
