          &emsp;I am an undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer
          Science at Northern Arizona University, with an anticipated graduation
          in Fall 2024. Currently, I hold a GPA of 3.31. Originally from Phoenix,
          Arizona, I plan to return to my hometown after graduation. In the
          meantime, I am based in Flagstaff, Arizona, where I am honing my
          skills as a game developer and software engineer. Over the past
          two years, I have completed several projects that demonstrate my
          growing expertise, with additional projects underway to further
          showcase my development.

          <h2>Craterstats</h2>
          <p>Craterstats is a program created by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). It is a tool to analyze and plot crater count data for planetary surfacing. The current version is developed by Greg Michael.</p>
          <p>My contribution to this program is through my Senior Capstone which is sponsored by Trent Hare of the USGS. Me and a team of 4 other classmates are tasked with creating
            a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the current version of craterstats. This current version is a python command line application. We have decided to make the GUI using 
            the flet python library which is an extension of flutter. I have developed the current prototype which can be found in the GitHub Repo listed below. More information and technical documentation about this project can be found at the website below.

          <h2>CarGame</h2>
          <p>CarGame is a game developed by me and 4 classmates for an end of semester project in our Virtual Worlds class. Virtual Worlds is a class to teach about Unity and C# development, while also teaching techniques of base game development.</p>
          <p>My contribution to this game is developing the car mechanics as well as some basic small details around the game.</p>
          <p>The next semester I took an independent study course with Professor Ashish Amresh. During this study it was my goal to upgrade the game by making it co-op multiplayer and then online multiplayer. After these new versions were created, I then had to recreate the game using Unity's Entity Component System (ECS). After converting the base game to ECS, another student, Siddharth Subramanian, and I collaborated on making the newly ECS game into a multiplayer game. This study was to help Siddharth in his masterâ€™s thesis of implementing generative AI into game development.</p>

          <h2>Side Quests</h2>
          <p>
            Side Quests is a website that 5 of my classmates and I developed during our sophomore year for our Software Engineering class.
            The website was designed to be a task tracking website that would reward points and "experience points" once a task is complete.
            The user would also be able to compare levels and rewards with their friends to entice them to complete tasks.
          </p>
          <p>My contribution to this project was to create the profile and rewards page. On this page both the information of the user
          that is logged in is displayed and the rewards they have received for the tasks completed.</p>
          <p>While the website itself is no longer active the GitHub page with all the code still is.</p>

          <p>Blog space is a small website using Express.js for my Web Development II course. This mini project was to create
            a dynamic website using Express.js and Bootstrap to create posts that are editable and deletable through HTTPS Request Methods
