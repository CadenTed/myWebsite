    <h2 class="Intro">Introduction</h2>
    <p>INSERT PICTURE HERE</p>
    <p>Hello! My name is Caden Tedeschi. I am attending Northern Arizona Universtiy as an undergrad student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I am expecting to graduate Fall 2024 and my current GPA is 2.93.
    I'm originally from Phoenix, Arizona, and plan on moving back down into that area once I graduate. I have been learning and practicing programming since I was a Freshman in highschool and I have loved it ever since.
    Thank you for taking the time to read and look at this page! :)</p>

    <h2 class="Projects">Projects</h2>
    <p>Throughout my college experience I have done many projects that were needed for my classes but here are a few that I believe are the most important. After the list of projects there will be a short description of each.
    This list will also be updated as time goes on.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>SideQuests</li>
      <li>Catnip Catcher</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>SideQuests</h3>
    <p>SideQuests was a semester long group project. This was a project that was during our Software Engineering class that taught skills of teamwork and development methods as well as the whole process of wokring on a project in a professional setting
    SideQuests is a MVP website that would allow for task tracking with a reward system to "Gameify" compeleting tasks off of a to-do list. I personally worked on the profile/rewards page of the website.
    These pages were to keep track of user profile data and the points that a user would get while completing tasks and display the trohpies earned accordingly.</p>
