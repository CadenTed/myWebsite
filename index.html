          &emsp;I am an undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer
          Science at Northern Arizona University, with an anticipated graduation
          in Fall 2024. Currently, I hold a GPA of 3.31. Originally from Phoenix,
          Arizona, I plan to return to my hometown after graduation. In the
          meantime, I am based in Flagstaff, Arizona, where I am honing my
          skills as a game developer and software engineer. Over the past
          two years, I have completed several projects that demonstrate my
          growing expertise, with additional projects underway to further
          showcase my development.

          <h2>Craterstats</h2>
          <p>Craterstats is a program created by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). It is a tool to analyze and plot crater count data for planetary surfacing. The current version is developed by Greg Michael.</p>
          <p>My contribution to this program is through my Senior Capstone which is sponsored by Trent Hare of the USGS. Me and a team of 4 other classmates are tasked with creating
            a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the current version of craterstats. This current version is a python command line application. We have decided to make the GUI using 
            the flet python library which is an extension of flutter. I have developed the current prototype which can be found in the Github Repo listed below. More information and technical documentation about this project can be found at the website below.

          <h2>CarGame</h2>
          <p>CarGame is a game developed by me and 4 classmates for a end of semester project in our Virtual Worlds class. Virtual Worlds is a class to teach about Unity and C# developement, while also teaching techniques of base game developement.</p>
          <p>My contribution to this game is developing the car mechanics as well as some basic small details around the game.</p>
          <p>The next semester I took an inependent study course with Profesoor Ashish Amresh. During this study it was my goal to upgrade the game by making it co-op multiplayer and then online multiplayer. After these new versions were created, I then had to recreate the game using Unity's Entity Component System (ECS). After converting the base game to ECS, another student, Siddharth Subramanian, and I collaberated on making the newly ECS game into a multiplayer game. This study was to help Siddharth in his masters thesis of implementing generative AI into game developement.</p>
