    <h4>About</h4>
    <p>I am an undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Northern Arizona University.
        I am expecting to graduate the fall semester of 2024 with
        a current GPA of 3.35. I am originally from Phoenix, Arizona with plans to move back after I graduate. In the
        meantime I am based out of Flagstaff, Arizona.
        I am working on my skills as a game developer and software developer/engineer. I have completed numerous
        projects within the last year that show these skills being increased,
        as well as more projects in the future to help show my growth.

        <h3>Catnip Catcher</h3>
        <p>Catnip Catcher is a prototype game that I started working on solo the summer of my Sophomore year.
            It is made using the 2D template of Unity, using Unity's built in C# functions as well as a few of my own.
            Catnip Catcher is a 2D overhead perspective game where the player controls one of two cats. The goal is to
            get 15 bags of catnip as one these cats without losing all 9 lives. While trying to get the catnip, your
            owner
            is trying to catch you. As more bags are gotten, more people appear to try and catch you and their speed
            increases.
        </p>
        <p>Demo Coming Soon!</p>

        <h3>SideQuests</h3>
        <p>SideQuests was a group project during my second semester sophomore year for my Software Engineering class.
            This class taught skills of teamwork
            and development methods as well as working on a project as a team using the Agile Method. SideQuests was an
            MVP website that
            would "Gameify" completing tasks and goals that the user had set. Completion of tasks would reward points
            and rewards depending
            on the amount of points a user has. We had future goals of being able to points and rewards with friends as
            an incentive for completing the tasks they had made.
        </p>
        <p>I had worked on the profile and rewards page. This page kept track of user information like name, date of
            birth, and occupation. It also
            kept track of the points the user had gotten and displayed the correct trophies accordingly.

        <h3>CarGame</h3>
        <p>CarGame is a work in progress group project over during my first semester of junior year for my Virtual
            Worlds class. This class goes over game development
            using the Unity game engine, with assignments throughout the semester showing of those skills learned.
            CarGame is a survival zombie driving game where the goal
            is to kill as many zombies within 5 minutes. The player controls a truck with a plow that kills the zombies
            on impact at a certain speed. during the course
            of the game there are power-ups spawned which either give more health to the player or explode the car and
            zombies around it. There are two types of zombies, normal
            zombies and bomb zombies, hitting the bomb zombies have the same effect as the bomb power-up.
        </p>
        <p> I worked on the car movement, choppy at first but later smoothed out, and the title screen.</p>
        <p>
            I am currently working on a new multiplayer feature using Unity's Netcode for GameObjects. I will also
            be working on turning the original single player game into an Entity Component System with Unity's Data
            Oriented Technology Stack rather than it being an Object Oriented. This is for an independent study
            under Professor Ashish Amresh.

        <h3>Lunar Pit Patrol</h3>
        <p>
            Lunar Pit Patrol is the name of my Senior Capstone group. Our groups project is making a GUI for the USGS's
            Crater Stats program.

    <h2>Future Project Ideas</h2>
    <p>These are a couple projects that I have an idea for.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Tactical Fighter</li>
        <li>Catnip Catcher 3D</li>
    </ul>

            <li>
                <h3 class="tf">Tactical Fighter</h3>
                <p class="tf">Tactical Fighter is currently a C# Console Application game that I worked on during the
                    summer of my Sophomore year of University. This game is a turn based fighting game
                    with random encounters of four different enemies. The player has a choice of classes between
                    Paladin, Knight, Ranger, Mage. I plan on implementing this game concept into Unity
                    and making a graphical version of the game.
                </p>

            <li>
                <h3 class="cc">Catnip Catcher 3D</h3>
                <p class="cc">Catnip Catcher 3D is the 3-Dimensional version of the catnip catcher game I previously
                    made.
